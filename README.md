The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce
application where products such as: books, electronics, fashion and home
appliances can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet.

● The app will represent a virtual store on the Internet where customers can
browse the catalog and select products of interest.

● The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the
items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more
information will be needed to complete the transaction. The customer will be
asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and
payment information such as credit card number.

● Features of the application includes:

○ Email notification with all the details will be sent to the customer once
order is placed.

○ Customers will also be able to check the expected time of delivery and
contact the seller through the portal. (Complaint feature).

○ A message inbox is given to the customer and seller to communicate with
each other.

○ There is also a seller module where sellers can register their products
which they wish to sell.

○ A push notification will be sent to the customer whenever a seller
registers a new product.
